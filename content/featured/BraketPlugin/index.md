This project focused on integrating [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/), an open-source quantum SDK, with [Amazon Braket's](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/) vast quantum hardware, fostering a unified global quantum computing platform. **Achieving this enables users to access varied quantum architectures with one programming language**, democratizing quantum computing and **facilitating experimentation, learning, and benchmarking of quantum processors**. This unified approach holds significant promise for the broader quantum community.
